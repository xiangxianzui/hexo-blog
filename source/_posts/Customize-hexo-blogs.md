In my previous [post](https://xiangxianzui.github.io/2017/01/Build-blogs-with-Hexo/), I introduced how to build personal blog site with the help of [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Now it's time to customize the hexo blog to show some personalities.

## _config.yml

*_config.yml* is the configuration file of your hexo blog (in project root dir).

Hexo lets you define your site information, customize date/time format, pagination behaviour, language settings, etc. Most configs are not necessary, but it will make your site look more like *yours* if you specify them properly.

Here is my site config:

``` bash
# Site
title: Muser
subtitle: Coding While Thinking
description: thinking in a different way
author: xiangxianzui
email: xiangxianzui@gmail.com
```

Url config: 

``` bash
# URL
## If your site is put in a subdirectory, set url as 'http://yoursite.com/child' and root as '/child/'
url: https://xiangxianzui.github.io
root: /
permalink: :year/:month/:title/
```

## Tags & Categories

Tags and Categories can be defined in the front matter of every post you create. Front matter is in the very beginning of your post. You can define tags and categories like this:

``` bash
tags: [Hexo, node.js]
categories: [Guides]
```

To delete a tag or category, firstly you need to delete it from the front matter of your post, then clean the hexo database (db.json in project root) and /public folder by typing:

``` bash
#Delete database
#Delete public folder
hexo clean
```

And then, regenerate the database and public folder by typing:

``` bash
hexo generate
```


## Asset Folders

As usual, you can reference online images in your markdown like this: `![image-title](http://some-image-site/some-image.png)`. But how to reference local images? Hexo gives you two options.

The first is to create a global asset folder. For example, create /images folder in /source directory, and put all your images into it. Then, you can reference them in this way: `![image-title](/images/image.png)`.

If you want to put your images according to post, which means one asset folder per post, you can set `post_asset_folder` to true in *_config.yml*. And when you `$ hexo new post [new-post]`, an asset folder will be created by hexo automatically.

## Enabling Comments

The default theme (landscape) of Hexo already supports [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). So, just go to Disqus, register an account, and click *install Disqus on site*. Follow the guideline, and specify a unique disqus shortname. After that, add this to your *_config.yml*.

``` bash
# Disqus comments
disqus_shortname: [your-disqus-shortname]
```

## RSS & Sitemap plugin

Use the official tool *hexo-generator-feed* to generate RSS feed. Firstly intall it:

``` bash
$ npm install hexo-generator-feed --save
```

Configure options in *_config.yml*:

``` bash
# RSS feed
feed:
  type: atom
  path: atom.xml
  limit: 20
  hub:
  content:
```

 - type - Feed type. (atom/rss2)
 - path - Feed path. (Default: atom.xml/rss2.xml)
 - limit - Maximum number of posts in the feed (Use 0 or false to show
   all posts)
 - hub - URL of the PubSubHubbub hubs (Leave it empty if you don't use
   it)
 - content - (optional) set to 'true' to include the contents of the
   entire post in the feed.

A *atom.xml* file will be generated automatically when you run `hexo generate`.

To generate sitemap, use the official [hexo-generator-sitemap](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap) plugin. 

``` bash
A sitemap is a file where you can list the web pages of your site to tell Google and other search engines about the organization of your site content. Search engine web crawlers like Googlebot read this file to more intelligently crawl your site.
```

## Customize default theme

### Add icons to navigation bar

I will explain how to add icons to the navigation bar in the default theme.

Open directory `/themes/landscape/source/css/_partial`, and find `header.styl`. Add following code:

```
#nav-github-link
  &:before
    content: "\f09b"
```

Then, open directory `/themes/landscape/layout/_partial`, find `header.ejs` and open it. Find the following section:

![Edit header.ejs](hexo-1.png)

**Note:** `theme` is a JavaScript object representation of the themeâ€™s `_config.yml` 

Add the code from line 22 to 24 to your header.ejs.

Finally, open `_config.yml` in `themes/landscape`, add code:

```
github: [your-github-address]
```

It may looks like this:

![Edit _config.yml](hexo-2.png)

Yess! Your navigation bar will look like this:

![new navigation bar](hexo-3.png)

### Change banner

In addition, you can change the banner of the page. The *banner.jpg* is in `/themes/landscape/source/css/images`, and you can replace it with your own.

### Show category count

Again, open the theme's `_config.yml`, set `show_count` to `true`.

Then, it will be looking like this:

![show category count](hexo-4.png)

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics tell the site owner about how many people have visited the website, how long they averagely stay and what kind of people visit (male or female? Asian or American?). It is a brilliant tool for site owners to grasp the whole picture.

The default theme, Landscape, is already supporting Google Analytics. If you are using Landscape or another theme which supports Google Analytics,  you can simply add your Google Analytics tracking ID (get tracking ID [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en)) to the theme's `_config.yml` like this:

``` bash
google_analytics: [your-tracking-id]
```

If your theme does not support Google Analytics, check [this post](http://www.codeblocq.com/2015/12/Add-Google-Analytics-to-your-hexo-blog/).

Until now, you have enabled Google Analytics in your site, but the question is you can't see it. To display the analytics from Google, you need to use Embed API. This [official guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/getting-started) is very helpful. Go through the guide and you'll make it!

Mine is like this:
