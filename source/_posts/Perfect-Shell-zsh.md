Recently, I bought a new laptop : HP Omen II Pro. Guess what? It is a **GAME LAPTOP**!!! Well, I confess that I couldn't wait to download GTA5 as soon as I got the laptop in my hands. But wait. I stopped myself from doing that. I **HAD TO** get into work. I had been working as an intern developer in Qunar for two weeks, and, my **old, slow, dumb** laptop really drives me crazy. I really want to kick its ass and throw it to the ground, but I didn't do that hahaha. I uninstalled the Windows 10 and took a flight to **Ubuntu**. It is the first time that I use Ubuntu as a standalone OS in my laptop. Cheers! 

Well, come to the point. I am a **"Ubuntuer"** from now on, so it's time to get it up--try the **perfect shell** in the world--**zsh**!
