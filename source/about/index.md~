I am a big fan of the English band *MUSE*. Charming timbre, mysterious and psychedelic lyrics, stormy live performances, are all elements that fascinate me. That's why I call myself *Muser*, which means *Muse follower*.

Besides *MUSE*, I am also a crazy fan of Manchester United FC. In July 2016, MUFC came to Shanghai and played a friendly game against Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai Stadium. I watched the game on the scene, though MUFC lost the game by 1:4. I also watched a training session after the game, and I had seen many MUFC stars, such as Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, David De Gea, and the coach Jose Mourinho. Fortunately, I got a personal signing of Ander Herrera, a talented Spanish midfielder who is popular in MUFC fans.

Currently, I am a third-grade graduate student in Nanjing, and I will work as a software developer in Hangzhou next year. In my daily life, I love playing table tennis, watching documentaries(history, cold-weapon era, etc.),
